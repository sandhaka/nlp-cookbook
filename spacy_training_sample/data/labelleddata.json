The ISO Governing Board earlier\nthe same day turned down the ISO management's request to force SCs to\nplace 95% of their scheduled load in the DA market.  That leaves the ISO\nlittle choice but to venture into the energy markets to procure power to\ncover their peak hours on hot days.\n\nTerry gave Ziad the OK to proceed with placing both the APX and\nCalifornia PX screens for this new product/matching-service.  I am\nworking with the two vendors and the ISO to make this happen quickly.\nWe anticipate that the market will open on Tuesday, September 5, or\nearlier.\n\nKey people who you may need to contact:\nISO - Ziad Alaywan  916-351-2140 (Nancy Traweek and Jim McIntosh are\nalso in the loop)\nPX - Ken Czarnecki 626-537-3123\nPX - John Yurkanin 626-537-3124\nAPX - Denice Cazalet 408-517-2123\nAPX - Michael Heinrich 408-517-2159\n\nPlease feel free to contact me with your questions.  Several of you have\nnot had the opportunity to attend the pre-design meetings we had at the\nCalifornia PX and APX a few weeks ago, nor were you aware of the joint\nWPTF/ISO meeting held last week.  But in essence, what this\nproduct/matching-service will allow you to do is post bids to sell, or\nbuy a 6-hour block of capacity at a firm energy price across the hours\nof HE13 to HE18.  You can bid at COB, Mead, PV, SP15 or NP15.  You can\nutilize either the CalPX or APX to post your bids, because the ISO will\nbe watching both screens.  The block sizes are (supposed to be) 25MW.\nThe seller is responsible for arranging transmission to the delivery\npoint, and the buyer (e.g., ISO) is responsible for arranging\ntransmission service from the delivery point.  The ISO will make its\npurchase decisions for the day-of at or before 8:00 a.m.  The ISO will\nsend out a general notice when it needs offers to sell on the super-peak\nmarket.  I expect that bids for either buy or sell will be able to be\nposted at any time, 24 hours.  The screens should allow parties to post\nbuy or sell bids at least 60 days forward of the trade day.\n\nYou are not limited to a price cap in these markets, but the ISO as a\nbuyer has the right to not purchase at prices above it's price cap.\n\nI think WPTF members should be very proud that we were able to quickly\nwork together, and with the ISO to create this market. I have no doubt\nthe ISO will be offering bids to purchase starting Sept 5, and going\nforward 60 days.  However, who among you will be willing and able to\npost bids to sell?\n\ngba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
